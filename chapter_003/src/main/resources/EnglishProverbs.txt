A bad excuse is better than none
Bad news travels fast
A cat has nine lives
Dead men tell no lies
Early to bed and early to rise
Facts speak louder than words
Gardens are not made by...
Half a loaf is better than none
An idle brain is the devil's workshop
Justice delayed is justice denied
Laughter is the best medicine
Make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
Necessity is the mother of invention
Once bitten, twice shy
Penny wise, pound foolish
Revenge is sweet
Save me from my friends
Tall oaks grow from little acorns
Union is strength
Walls have ears
You are what you eat
